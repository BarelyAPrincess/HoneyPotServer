# Code Style

Our Gradle Build environment uses the CodeStyle plugin to check coding standards, as follows:

* Please attempt at making your code as easily understandable as possible. Use variables with human-readable names, like `mergeWithParent` instead of `var2`. We also recommend when possible to use human-readable names for both lambda expressions and generics.
* Leave comments whenever possible. Adding Javadoc is even more appreciated when possible.
* No spaces; use tabs. We like our tabs, sorry. What do you think this is - the dark ages?
* No trailing whitespace.
* Brackets should always be on a new line. Does not impact completion and makes code easier to understand.
* No 80 column limit or 'weird' mid-statement newlines, try to keep your entire statement on one line.
