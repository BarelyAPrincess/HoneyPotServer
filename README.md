# Welcome

_Honey Pot Server_ is a multi-protocol networking server allowing for both dynamic and static content via a powerful subsystem consisting of modular classes, plugins, and built-in Groovy scripting language. Features also include ORM, events, clustering, users, permissions, enforced access policies, and much more. Nearly everything was designed with an extendable concept in mind and can be extended using the provided API. HPS is intended to provide easy-access to the best of the best Java 8 features without the mess and time constants of traditional Java servers. HPS also honors convention over configuration, most everything will work with little to no additional setup, even its libraries are downloaded directly from Maven. We strive to make the code base as easy to understand as possible by leaving out needless interfaces and classes whenever possible.

**NOTICE: Honey Pot Server is under extensive heavy-development. It is possible that claims made by this documentation is not yet valid.**
