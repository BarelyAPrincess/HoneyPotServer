When submitting an issue, please take into account the following points.

* Decide where your issue belongs. If it is non-technical or
  conversational, it might be better-suited to [Discord](https://discord.gg/5uKQjhY).
  If you're not sure, then just head to Discord and someone will direct you to the correct place.
* Make sure nobody else has already reported the issue.
  You can find a search bar above [the list of issues](https://github.com/BarelyAPrincess/HoneyPotServer/search?type=Issues).
  If you've found a similar or identical issue, consider leaving a comment there instead.
* Describe your issue clearly, giving instructions on how to reproduce it as far as you can.
* If you have an error log, be sure to include it, preferably at the bottom of your issue description.
* Be courteous and understand that HoneyPotServer and similar projects are maintained by
  passionate (but unpaid) individuals, in a team that is **much** smaller
  than similar teams for projects like Minecraft, Forge, Bukkit, and Spigot.
* Remember that we apply the [No Code of Conduct](https://github.com/domgetter/NCoC). 
  If it isn't about HoneyPotServer as an application (or its code), then it doesn't belong here.
  Keep things professional and impersonal.
* If English isn't your first language, we would prefer that you give it a try,
  but feel free to also include a version of the ticket in your native language.
  For example, if you're better at Russian, include both an English and a Russian
  version. It will help us to understand what you mean better.

Title: **Short description of the issue**

HoneyPotServer version and build: 2018.0 #123 (Never say *"latest"*, always check what build you're using)
If you are reporting a bug from the bleeding-edge branch, this isn't likely the place for them.

Describe your problem in detail here. Explain what you were doing at the time,
what any other players were doing (if applicable), what you were expecting to happen,
and what actually happened.

Explain the steps we can take to reproduce your problem. Ensure that they work - install
a fresh copy of HoneyPotServer and try them out yourself to make sure they're accurate, at least
as far as possible. Going the extra mile is always appreciated.

If you have found issues that might relate to the one you're reporting, include links to them
or use `#123`, where `123` is the number of the issue you want to refer to.

Include any logs that you feel are relevant at the bottom. Surround them with three backticks 
( **`** ) on the lines directly above and below to ensure they're easy to read. If you don't do this,
a staff member may do it for you, so please don't be alarmed if that happens!
