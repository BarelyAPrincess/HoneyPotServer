# HoneyPotServer is OPEN Open Source Project

## What?

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
2. **Besides branches `master-dev`, `incubating`, and `stable`** ought to be short lived and used for experimental ongoing work. Please clean-up after yourself.
3. **Don't commit to the `stable` branch,** it's only for formal releases declared stable by the project maintainer by pull-request only.
4. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
5. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
6. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
